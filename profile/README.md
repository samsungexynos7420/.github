# Samsung Exynos 7420 Github
The unofficial Samsung Exynos 7420 GitHub org.

Currently supporting Lineage 18.1, Lineage 19.1 and Lineage 20 (not other AOSP/forks). You can find a sample local_manifest here: <https://github.com/samsungexynos7420/local_manifests>

Building LineageOS 19.1 and 20 requires patching the sources in order to get boot and some functions working properly. All the patches that are needed for this are located at <https://github.com/samsungexynos7420/7420_patches> and **MUST** be applied. 

If you want to support another OS or provide a fix/improvement, open a pull request!
