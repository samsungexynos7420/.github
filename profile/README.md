# Samsung Exynos 7420 Github
This is the (unofficial) GitHub for Samsung Exynos 7420 development.

This GitHub supports Lineage 18.1, Lineage 19.1 and Lineage 20. 

Building LineageOS 19.1 and 20 requires patching the sources in order to get boot and functions working properly. All the patches that are needed for this are located at <https://github.com/samsungexynos7420/7420_patches> and **MUST** be applied, else you will not get a working device. 

This org currently does **NOT** support OSes other than LineageOS. It may be possible to get other AOSP forks working. 

If you want to support another OS or provide a fix/improvement, open a pull request!

# Currently supported devices:
- Samsung Galaxy S6
- Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge
- Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ (11 only, WIP)
- Samsung Galaxy Note5
