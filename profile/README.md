# ðŸ”¥ Samsung Exynos 7420 Organization ðŸ”¥
The (un)official Samsung Exynos 7420 GitHub organization. Attempting to tame and update the 7420 since 2022.

Currently supporting Lineage 18.1, Lineage 19.1 and Lineage 20 (not other AOSP/forks). You can find a sample local_manifest here: <https://github.com/samsungexynos7420/local_manifests>

Building LineageOS 19.1 or later requires patching the sources in order to get boot and some functions working properly. All the patches that are needed for this are located at <https://github.com/samsungexynos7420/7420_patches> and **MUST** be applied. 

# Currently supported devices:
- Samsung Galaxy S6 (International, TMobile, Canada)
- Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (International, TMobile, Canada)
- Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ (International, TMobile, Canada)
- Samsung Galaxy Note5 (International, TMobile, Canada)

# Supported OSes

- Lineage 19.1 (A12L)
- Lineage 20.0 (A13)
