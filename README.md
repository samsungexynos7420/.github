# Samsung Exynos 7420 
The goal of this org is to support Exynos 7420 based devices on newer versions of Android (specifically LineageOS), more than the original manufacturer intended. 

Currently, this means modifying Android slightly in order to get the OS booting and functional. All the patches that are needed for this are located at <https://github.com/samsungexynos7420/7420_patches> and **MUST** be applied, else you will not get a working device. 

This org currently does **NOT** support OSes other than LineageOS. It may be possible to get other AOSP forks working. 

If you want to support another OS or provide a fix/improvement, open a pull request!

# Currently supported devices:
- Samsung Galaxy S6
- Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge
- Samsung Galaxy Note5 (12.1 only)
**WIP** 
- Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ (12.1 only)
